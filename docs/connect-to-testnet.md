## What Is the Testnet
In general, there are two types of networks.

1. The mainnet
1. The testnet

The mainnet is the production environment which is oriented to work for the real use. For instance, the mainnet of the Interledger Protocol would use the real money to transfer.

In contradiction to the mainnet, the testnet is to test functions of the network safely, which means for the Interledger Protocol the network doesn't deal with the real money. So the testnet is suitable for trying out what you built or even what you are building.
